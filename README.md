# Badger-Hackathon-2021
This project is a music player/visualizer for .WAV files. It was created for the 2021 Badger Hackathon.
Authors: Nathanael Acker, Khalil Horton, Alex Sannikov

# What it does:
With this program, you can input a .WAV file, play and pause it, and of course, view the visualizer for the music! You can 
also change the color of the visualizer.

# How we did it:
We used Python, many libraries, and some online sources to create our project. These sources are linked in soucres.txt, as well
as in our program.
